## the main difference between OSI model and TCP/IP model
The OSI model is a seven-layer model that describes how communication occurs between two computers at different layers of abstraction. The layers of the OSI model are:
- Physical
- Data link
- Network
- Transport
- Session
- Presentation
- Application

The TCP/IP model is a four-layer model that describes how communication occurs between two computers on the Internet. The layers of the TCP/IP model are:

- Network interface
- Internet
- Transport
- Application

## Explaining the application service layers and what happen when you write your url and click enter.
The application layer is the highest layer of the OSI model, and it is responsible for providing services to the user.

When you write a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your web browser and click enter, the following sequence of events occurs at the application layer:

- Your web browser sends a request to the server to retrieve the page associated with the URL.
- The server receives the request and processes it. This may involve looking up the requested page in a database or generating the page dynamically using a server-side programming language like PHP.
- The server sends the requested page back to the web browser in the form of an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) response.
- The web browser receives the response and renders the page for the user to view.

## Explaining what is a domain name and the relation between the DNS and the @IP address.

A domain name is a human-readable label that is used to identify a specific website or other internet resource. Domain names are used as an alternative to IP addresses, which are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to the internet.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database that is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to look up the corresponding IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address, and your computer uses this address to establish a connection to the server.

## Explain the TCP interconnection between your local host and the serve
- The client establishes a connection to the server by sending a TCP SYN (synchronize) packet.
- The server responds with a packet to acknowledge the connection request.
- The client sends a packet to confirm that the connection has been established.

after tcp connection:
- The client sends a request to the server, which is transmitted in one or more TCP packets.
- The server receives the request and processes it. This may involve looking up data in a database or generating a response dynamically using a server-side programming language.
- The server sends a response to the client, which is transmitted in one or more TCP packets.
- The client receives the response and processes it. For example, if the client is a web browser, it may render the received data as a web page.

## How data transfer over internet (TCP Packet)

Data is transferred over the internet using packets, which are small units of data that are transmitted between devices on a network. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet.

When a client (such as a web browser) wants to send data to a server (such as a web server), it breaks the data down into smaller packets and sends each packet to the server over the network. The packets are transmitted using the Internet Protocol (IP), which is a protocol for routing data between different networks.

Each packet contains a header, which is a set of metadata that is used to identify and route the packet, and a payload, which is the actual data being transmitted. The header includes information such as the source and destination addresses, the packet size, and a sequence number.
